# Vanilla JS Counter App

This is a simple counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The counter increases each time the button is clicked and updates the text using DOM manipulation.

Tech used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Project structure:
index.html
style.css
script.js

Concepts practiced:
DOM selection
Event handling
Updating text content
Using a state variable
Purpose:
This project was created to practice basic JavaScript and DOM event handling.
I built this first in plain JavaScript to understand how it works without frameworks, before creating the same type of app in React and learning the differences.
