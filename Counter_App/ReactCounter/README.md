# React Counter App

This is a simple counter application built using React to understand how state works using the useState hook.

## What I did

- Creating a functional React component
- Using the useState hook to manage state
- Updating state on button click
- Automatically updating the UI when state changes
- Linking and using component-specific CSS

## How It Works

The counter value is stored in a state variable using useState.  
When the button is clicked, the state is updated using the setter function.  
React re-renders the component and the updated count is displayed on the screen.

There is no direct DOM manipulation. The UI is driven by state.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- CSS

### How to Run

Install dependencies: npm install
Start development server: npm run dev
